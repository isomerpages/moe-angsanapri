### Pedagogical Approaches

Our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) teaching pedagogy stems from the constructivism paradigm in which our students will construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences. The teaching of CCE is process-based and focuses on the “why” and “how” instead of “what”. We aim to facilitate the learning of skills and internalisation of values through action and reflection as our students learn best when they are actively engaged. Our teachers use a repertoire of process-based approaches and select the most appropriate instructional strategies to engage students in the learning of CCE.

**Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)**  
  
To nurture skills for students’ social and emotional, and mental well-being, our FTGP lessons are time and space created for meaningful teacher-student interactions. Through these specially designed interaction activities, our teachers garner a firmer understanding of every student, strengthen the holistic development of every student, to build a good rapport as well as quality class and team spirit. Topics covered include Cyberwellness, Peer-Support and Social Skills.   
  

**Assembly Programmes** 
  
Assembly programme is conducted weekly, to support the holistic development of every student.

**Meet My Teacher**
  
To build positive teacher-student relationships, our students get to meet their Form and Co-form teachers at least once per term. This one-to-one teacher-student interaction time allows our teachers to build quality teacher-student relationships via an in-depth knowledge of every child. Our teachers are able to identify our students’ needs and nurture character traits, dispositions and attitudes. In addition, through this platform, we are able to guide our students to set realistic academic and non-academic targets as well as provide timely feedback on their learning progress. 


**Kindness@Angsana** 
  
Kindness@Angsana aims to educate and motivate all of our students to engage in kind actions. Our Friend of Singa (FoS) student ambassadors are empowered to find and implement solutions to promote kindness within the school and the community.

**Beyond Boundaries**
  
To develop a sense of global perspective beyond Singapore in our students, our local and overseas immersion programmes deepen our students’ knowledge about cultures, practices and traditions in other countries. It also provides opportunities for interaction between Angsana Primary School students and their overseas counterparts. 

**Values-in-Action (VIA)**
  
Students go through various learning experiences to develop socially as responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to their home and community. Students at every level get to be part of a VIA project which enables them to put into practice the values, knowledge and skills that they have learnt. They also do their part to daily keep their classroom and school clean as part of their ‘Everyday Responsibilities’.

**Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**
  
Through our structured ECG lessons and programmes, our students develop an awareness on their interests, abilities and career aspirations as well as develop a better understanding of oneself in relation to others and their work. They also become aware of their initial preferences in occupational roles assumed in play. Our Primary 5 and 6 pupils are given opportunities to explore their educational and career interests via the online resource ecareers.sg portal during FTGP lessons.
