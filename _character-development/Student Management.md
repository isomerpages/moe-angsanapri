### Learning Outcomes

  

#### Vision: To Discipline is to Care  
Goal: Self-disciplined students of good moral character

  

Student Management is actually an educative process focusing on the development of our studentsâ€™ moral faculties through instruction and routines. We aim to guide our students to live by our school values of Respect, Resilience, Responsibility &amp; Integrity. We hope to develop our students into individuals with self-discipline, and who take responsibility for their own actions, while demonstrating care for others around them.

**Student Recognition**

The student recognition platform recognises students who demonstrate positive values and attitudes in their day-to-day activities.

*   **Students Acting Right (StAR) Awards**&nbsp;encourage students to live up to the school values -&nbsp;care, respect, resilience, responsibility, teamwork and integrity. Each term, deserving pupils are presented with the award based on the value chosen for the term.
