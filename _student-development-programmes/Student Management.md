Student Management is actually an educative process focusing on the development of our students’ moral faculties through instruction and routines. We aim to guide our students to live by our school values of Respect, Resilience, Responsibility & Integrity. We hope to develop our students into individuals with self-discipline, and who take responsibility for their own actions, while demonstrating care for others around them.

  

<u><b>Student Recognition</u></b>

  

The student recognition platform recognises students who demonstrate positive values and attitudes in their day-to-day activities.

  

*   <b>Students Acting Right (StAR) Awards</b> encourage students to live up to the school values - care, respect, resilience, responsibility, teamwork and integrity. Each term, deserving pupils are presented with the award based on the value chosen for the term.

*   <b>Positive Attitude, Good Progress (P.A.G.E.) Awards</b> are awarded termly to selected students who fulfil the criteria of regular attendance and good behaviour. This award is exclusively for the FAS students.

*   <b>Praise Cards</b> is a recognition platform whereby pupils who perform positive actions are praised via cards written by the teachers. The cards are displayed for the school to view and are commendations for the good work they have done.

*   <b>Edusave Character Award (ECHA)</b>
    
    The ECHA is given to up to 2% of students who have demonstrated exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviours and actions.
    
      
    
    The values of the award are as follows:
    
    *   $200 for Primary 1 to 3
    *   $350 for Primary 4 to 6
    
      
    
    In ASPS, students are nominated for this award by their peers, teachers, parents and other stakeholders. Nominees go through a stringent check of their credentials via several rounds of deliberation and an interview before being endorsed as a recipient of this award.
