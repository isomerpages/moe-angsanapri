<h1>Programme for Active Learning</h1>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>PAL stands for Programme for Active Learning. It consists of modules in
4 different domains namely Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Visual
Arts and Performing Arts, which provide broad exposure to the pupils.</p>
<p>While in the orientation years of the primary school, we aim to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Provide our young pupils with not just the content knowledge, but also
mastering skills and acquiring values to thrive in the future</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop our pupils holistically, as PAL contributes to a well-rounded
curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop our pupils’ Social Emotional Learning (SEL). For example, we teach
pupils to manage and express their emotions when they win or lose in a
game</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pedagogical Approaches</h3>
<p>In Angsana Primary School, we adapt Kraft and Sakofs (1988) experiential
education model known as the Engage-Discover-Reflect (EDR) model:</p>

<p>In addition, for PAL to be effective and achieving its intent, we employ
other pedagogies which includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Inquiry-based Learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiential Learning</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>PAL Domains</h3>
<p>PAL Domains include:</p>
<p><strong>Sports and Games – Fundamental Movement</strong>
<br>This module introduces pupils to the elements of sports &amp; games through
basic fundamental movement. Elements of teambuilding games are also incorporated.
Pupils learn through movement exploration, creative movement and modified
sports and games. Through this module, Primary 1 pupils will learn to express
their emotions and increase their spatial and bodily awareness as well
as locomotor / non-locomotor skills. Moving forward in Primary 2, pupils
will learn how to work cooperatively with one another such as resolving
conflicts and differences.</p>
<p><strong>Outdoor Education – Nature for Kids</strong>
<br>In this module, pupils get the opportunity to explore the great outdoors
in its natural form. They will have a wide range of experiences ranging
from basic orienteering around the school, packing for the outdoors, first
aid application and even get to grow their own herbs! Through these meaningful
activities, pupils will learn to appreciate the nature and Singapore's
rich biodiversity through the study of flora and fauna and the community
living in it.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Arts – Creative Expression</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 1 pupils will learn about basic elements of art and have fun
working collaboratively to create patterned tiles on paper using compressed
foam boards. This allows the pupils to practise responsible decision making
by identifying problems, evaluating and reflecting on their learning processes.</p>
<p>Our Primary 2 pupils will create and explore possibilities using a combination
of clay and recyclables, collaboratively transforming their work into an
installation. The group activities help the pupils build good relationships
with their peers. This is done through taking another’s perspective, exploring
and experimenting with the provided tools, cooperating as they share tools,
and negotiating roles and material use.</p>
<p>Experimental in nature, these art activities not only provide opportunities
for pupils to create, but also incorporate social emotional learning such
as relationship management, helping them to forge good relationships with
other pupils and being expressive through group interaction, presentations
and experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>Performing Arts – Speech and Drama</strong>
</p>
<p>Speech and drama offers children the opportunity to master techniques
and skills necessary for effective communication. Our Primary 1 and Primary
2 pupils will learn to use elements of drama to build their self-confidence
and collaborative skills to enhance their cognitive development. Through
this experience, our pupils will also develop their social skills as they
interact and perform together in groups.</p>
