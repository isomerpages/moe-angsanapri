Student Leadership Programme
============================

_To Nurture Leaders of Character_


In Angsana Primary School, we want all students to be Leaders of Character. They are able to lead themselves in terms of words and actions, which are grounded on school values. 'Leading self' is the fundamental of the student leadership programme (as illustrated in the framework).

  

Students with leadership qualities are given the opportunities to take on other leadership roles such as Class Monitors, Sports Captains and Prefects. These roles enable them to lead their class, grade level or school. To prepare the student leaders, the school conducts training sessions and camp, twice a year to equip the student leaders with the knowledge and skills.
