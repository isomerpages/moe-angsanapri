NE and Values in Action
=======================

### Learning Outcomes


As part of holistic education, National Education in Angsana Primary teaches the pupils to:

*   study and play in harmony with pupils of different nationalities and ethnic groups. They learn to respect and appreciate diversity.
*   appreciate the unique history of Singapore, love the nation and be a responsible citizen, who contributes to the community.

### Pedagogical Approaches


In Angsana Primary School, we provide opportunities for our pupils to be familiar with and internalise the NE messages at the end of six years of their primary education.

  

Through in-depth classroom discussions and engaging NE events and activities, which are customised to different levels, pupils are engaged in meaningful conversations that enable them to understand Singapore, its history and people, better.

  

NE-focused lessons are integrated into Social Studies and Character & Citizenship Education lessons.

### Key Programmes


<b>NE Core Events</b>

  

The four NE core events we commemorate are:

*   Total Defence Day
*   International Friendship Day
*   Racial Harmony Day
*   National Day

  

The commemoration of NE events run on themes where classroom and / or level activities are customised for pupils as they get a holistic experience of the event.

  

<b>Values-in-Action</b>

Values-in-Action (VIA) are experiences that support pupils development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through learning and application of values, knowledge and skills.

  

In Angsana Primary, pupils are given opportunities to demonstrate the school values through programmes such as Project Sparkles and Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM). Through these programmes, pupils are able to discuss issues, make responsible decisions and reflect on the situation.

  

<b>Project Sparkles</b>

Project Sparkles takes pupils on a journey where they develop a deeper understanding of and make an impact in the importance of keeping our environment clean. All pupils of Angsana are on board to keep Angsana Primary School sparkling clean, where they take ownership of the canteen.

  

For VIA project, the pupils will participate in class discussions, to explore how they can play a part in upkeeping cleanliness at home, in school and the community. Their work will focus on the 3As, namely Action, Awareness or Advocacy.
