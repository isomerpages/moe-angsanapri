*   Acquire social awareness and apply interpersonal skills to build and maintain positive relationship based on mutual respect
*   Be resilient and have the ability to turn challenges into opportunities

*   Care for others and contribute actively to the progress of our community and nation
*   and respond to community, national and global issues, as an informed and responsible citizen.

### Pedagogical Approaches

Our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) teaching pedagogy stems from the constructivism paradigm in which our students will construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences. The teaching of CCE is process-based and focuses on the “why” and “how” instead of “what”. We aim to facilitate the learning of skills and internalisation of values through action and reflection as our students learn best when they are actively engaged. Our teachers use a repertoire of process-based approaches and select the most appropriate instructional strategies to engage students in the learning of CCE.

### Key Programmes

<b> CCE Lessons </b>

CCE lessons are taught in the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) and English Language. Lessons are thematic or event-based and aim to teach the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to develop our students to become good individuals and useful citizens.

<b> Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) </b>

To nurture skills for students’ social and emotional, and mental well-being, our FTGP lessons are time and space created for meaningful teacher-student interactions. Through these specially designed interaction activities, our teachers garner a firmer understanding of every student, strengthen the holistic development of every student, to build a good rapport as well as quality class and team spirit. Topics covered include Cyberwellness, Peer-Support and Social Skills.

<b>Meet My Teacher</b>

To build positive teacher-student relationships, our students get to meet their Form and Co-form teachers at least once per term. This one-to-one teacher-student interaction time allows our teachers to build quality teacher-student relationships via an in-depth knowledge of every child. Our teachers are able to identify our students’ needs and nurture character traits, dispositions and attitudes. In addition, through this platform, we are able to guide our students to set realistic academic and non-academic targets as well as provide timely feedback on their learning progress.

<b>Beyond Boundaries</b>

To develop a sense of global perspective beyond Singapore in our students, our local and overseas immersion programmes deepen our students’ knowledge about cultures, practices and traditions in other countries. It also provides opportunities for interaction between Angsana Primary School students and their overseas counterparts.
