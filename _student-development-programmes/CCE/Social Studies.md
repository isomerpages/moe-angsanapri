Social Studies
==============

Social Studies lessons aim to teach our students about Singapore and the world around them. It helps instil in our pupils an appreciation and understanding of the diversity that they see around them. Lessons take an inquiry based approach where pupils are encouraged to wonder, think and reflect. Lessons also go beyond the classroom when pupils go on field-based learning journeys to heritage sites in Singapore. This provides the pupils opportunities to make connections between what is learnt in the classroom and see and experience these for themselves.

  

<b>Field-Based Learning - Visits to Heritage Sites</b>

  

Every pupil will embark on a cultural and historical experiential learning programme from Primary 4 onwards. These learning journeys help to foster a sense of national pride of our rich cultural and historical heritage. Through these experiences, pupils will learn to cherish the common bond which holds our society together as a nation.

  

The following table lists the level and the corresponding heritage sites to be visited.
