In Angsana Primary School, it is our vision to develop and nurture every of our students to be 21st Century Leaders. We are committed to this endeavour through **Equipping** students with diversified range of learning opportunities, such our school-based enrichment and lifeskills programmes that span across five areas – Citizenship, Self-Management and Social Skills, Physical Activities and Sports, Aesthetics, and Enterprise. By **Empowering and Engaging** them through leadership opportunities, students continue to hone and apply leadership skills in various service opportunities. Through these learning experiences, we would see a **Confident Leader**, who is a **Reflective Self**, **Collaborative Team Player**, **Resilient Problem Solver** and **Effective Communicator**.
