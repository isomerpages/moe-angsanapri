Student Leadership Development
==============================

In Angsana Primary School, it is our vision to develop and nurture every of our students to be 21st Century Leaders. We are committed to this endeavour through <b>Equipping</b> students with diversified range of learning opportunities, such our school-based enrichment and lifeskills programmes that span across five areas – Citizenship, Self-Management and Social Skills, Physical Activities and Sports, Aesthetics, and Enterprise. By <b>Empowering and Engaging</b> them through leadership opportunities, students continue to hone and apply leadership skills in various service opportunities. Through these learning experiences, we would see a <b>Confident Leader</b>, who is a <b>Reflective Self</b>, <b>Collaborative Team Player</b>, <b>Resilient Problem Solver</b> and <b>Effective Communicator</b>.
