Co-Curricular Activities
========================

### Learning Outcomes

The CCA Programme is an integral part of our students' holistic education in Angsana Primary School.

  

The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups. CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21stÂ Century Competencies.

  

All CCAs emphasize social interaction by providing a common space for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds. Through CCA, students develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.
