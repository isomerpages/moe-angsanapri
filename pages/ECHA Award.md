2023 MOE Edusave Character Award

In 2012, MOE introduced the Edusave Character Award (ECHA) to enable schools to recognise
students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their
behaviour and actions. This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore as
schools broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded.

At Angsana Primary School, we wish to recognise students who consistently live up to the school
values and are good role models to others around them.

To be eligible for the award, the student must be a Singapore Citizen. He/She should attain a
conduct grade of either “Very Good” or ‘Excellent’ for the current year. For a more holistic
representation of the awardees, the school will be gathering input from teachers, parents, students
and other stakeholders, which include CCA coaches and school vendors. We would like to invite
parents and other stakeholders to nominate students who are deserving of the award. You may
download the form from the school website and submit it after completion to the school office by
Friday, 1 September 2023.
