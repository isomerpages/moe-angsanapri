<h3>Nurturing Problem Solvers using Computational Thinking</h3>
<p>In our school, we lead our students to experience the joy of learning
and be intrinsically motivated to embrace lifelong learning. In alignment
with our mission to engage and empower our students to be future-ready,
we recognise the importance of intentionally teaching 21st century skills
thus we provide opportunities for our students to develop aptitudes and
attitudes such as critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities.</p>
<p>We are aware that we can no longer anticipate all the problems and challenges
that our students will face in the future. With such ambiguities and complexities,
the skills of being able to recognise patterns, break down problems and
come out with relevant solutions are critical ones required of our students
to thrive in the workforce in future. Thus, as a school, it is a priority
to lead students to think critically, be savvy at problem-solving and develop
an ‘I Can’ attitude when faced with challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Key Focus Areas </strong>
<br>Through our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), students develop Computational
Thinking (CT) concepts such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction
and algorithm design. They also develop CT attitudes such as imagination,
thinking out of the box, making productive mistakes, collaboration and
persevering to find solutions.</p>
<p>By equipping our students with these key attitudes and skills early at
the primary school level, we lay the foundation for our students to remain
steadfast, competitive and be well adapted in the volatile, uncertain,
complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world. Through our Applied Learning Programme
(ALP), students develop Computational Thinking (CT) concepts such as decomposition,
pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithm design. They also develop
CT attitudes such as imagination, thinking out of the box, making productive
mistakes, collaboration and persevering to find solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Positive outcomes of ALP for students </strong>
<br>Students develop critical thinking skills that enhance their abilities
to solve problems in real life proactively and effectively. They work well
in teams and collaborate with their peers to achieve a common goal. Through
it all, students cultivate a lively curiosity about their environment and
want to do something to make it better.</p>
<p><strong>Integration into the Curriculum </strong>
<br>The programme takes off by introducing the lower primary students to the
five Computational Thinking (CT) concepts; pattern recognition, decomposition,
algorithmic design and, generalisation and abstraction through enrichment
lessons. Thereafter, the teaching of problem solving skills through Computational
Thinking are infused in our Mathematics curriculum in a spiral approach.</p>

<p><strong>Customised Coding Lessons </strong>
<br>Learning experiences to develop CT attitudes such as imagination, thinking
out of the box, making productive mistakes, collaboration and persevering
to find solutions through various modes are created for students at different
levels.</p>
