<p>Raffles Student Care Centre was established in 2008 and has been operating
community and school-based student care and KCare centres at various locations
across the country. Guided by our Company Vision of <strong>Building Our Next Generation</strong>,
we inculcate core values and life skills to our young children to ensure
they grow up well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;KCare is a service offered to parents whose children attend MOE
Kindergarten and need care services beyond the 4-hour programme of MK.</p>
<p>Our KCare centre operates from 7am to 7pm on Mondays to Fridays, including
school holidays. We operate half-days on Christmas Eve, New Year’s Eve
and Chinese New Year’s Eve. The centre will be closed up to 6 days each
year, in addition to public holidays.</p>
<p>The KCare programme has been designed to complement the MOE Kindergarten’s
curriculum. It emphasises the provision of time and space for children
to play, explore and discover. The programme also focuses on the importance
of providing opportunities for the children to develop confidence, self-help
skills, social skills and values such as responsibility, care and respect
in a safe and conducive environment.</p>
