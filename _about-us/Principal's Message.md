Welcome to the website of Angsana Primary School! The contents will give you a good understanding of our school and our mission in preparing our students for the future.




<b>A Little about me</b>

I embarked on my career in education as a Chemistry and Mathematics teacher. Due to unique circumstances in the first few years, I had opportunities to teach various subjects in the secondary school curriculum. This experience allowed me to understand the significance of interdisciplinary learning. Through this exposure, I gained a deep appreciation for the fusion of knowledge and perspectives from various disciplines and the range of pedagogy for teaching different subjects. I led two other primary schools after a meaningful stint as a Vice-Principal in a Catholic secondary school before coming to Angsana Primary School.

<b>A merger of two great schools</b>
         
Angsana Primary School today is the result of&nbsp;**the merging of two long-established primary schools**&nbsp;in the Tampines. These two institutions have nurtured young minds for an impressive 145 years, giving us a vibrant heritage.
