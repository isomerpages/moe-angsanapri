Dear Students, Parents, and Staff,

I hope this message finds you well. As the principal of Angsana Primary School, I would like to take this opportunity to address our school community and share some important updates.

First and foremost, I want to express my deep appreciation for the dedication and resilience shown by each member of our school community. The past year has presented us with unprecedented challenges, and I am continually amazed by the strength and adaptability you have all displayed.
