<center><b>A Decade of Growth, A Vision for the Future</b></center>

   

As we step into 2025, we find ourselves at a momentous juncture. This year marks not only our school's 10th anniversary but also coincides with Singapore's diamond jubilee— 60 years of nationhood. Our theme, "Together Towards Tomorrow!"  encapsulates the spirit of unity and forward-thinking that has always defined our school.

In 2024, we embarked on a significant re-envisioning exercise with our staff. This process was born from our recognition that the world our students will inherit is evolving at an unprecedented pace, presenting both complex challenges and exciting opportunities. It became clear that to truly serve our students, we needed to refresh our vision and align it more closely with the demands of our rapidly changing society.

I am proud to unveil our new Vision: "**A Community of Curious Minds and Serving Hearts**". This vision reflects our commitment to nurturing lifelong learners who possess the essential qualities of curiosity and adaptability, coupled with a deep-seated desire to serve others. We believe that by fostering these attributes, we can prepare our students not just to navigate the future, but to shape it positively.

Complementing this vision is our new Mission: "**To empower our learning community to lead, care and serve**". This mission statement underscores our dedication to creating an environment where every member of our school community—students and staff alike—is empowered to grow, learn, and lead with purpose.

Achieving this Vision and Mission is not a task for the school alone. It requires the collective effort of our entire community. We warmly invite parents and stakeholders to join us on this exciting journey. Your involvement and support are crucial in making our vision a reality and in ensuring that our students are well-prepared to make meaningful contributions to Singapore and the world.

As we celebrate our 10th anniversary and look forward to the next decade, let us embrace this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to excellence in education. Together, we can create a learning environment that is not only relevant and forward-thinking but also nurtures individuals who are curious, compassionate, and ready to serve.

Here's to the next chapter in our school's story—one that we will write together, towards a brighter tomorrow!
