<center><b>Forging A New Chapter, With Gratitude</b></center>

2024 marks a milestone for Angsana Primary School as we embark on a new chapter in her illustrious journey. It is with deep gratitude and heartfelt appreciation that I acknowledge the remarkable legacy woven into the very fabric of this school as I take over the leadership. Angsana Primary School stands today as a testament to the visionary leadership and unwavering dedication of our founding principal, Ms Foong Yin Wei, who guided us through the merging of two storied institutions, Qiaonan and Griffiths Primary School back in 2015.

Under her stewardship for the past 9 years, our school blossomed, merging rich histories and traditions while embracing a future brimming with promise and potential. In 2022, she led the school in the move to the new premise in 51 Tampines Street 61. This is an important milestone where staff and students get to benefit from the new school facilities and also be part of the community in Tampines. As we celebrate almost a decade of our establishment, we stand on the shoulders of those who laid the foundation, honoring their enduring legacy and embracing the infinite opportunities that lie ahead. Thank you Ms Foong for your steadfast leadership through the years!

The essence of Angsana’s journey is not only defined by its profound roots, but it is also marked by its youthful vigor and boundless possibilities. As the new Principal of the school, I am eagerly excited and energized by the myriad of prospects that await us. We stand at the crossroads of tradition and innovation, poised to carve a path that honors our heritage while pioneering new frontiers of excellence.

Central to our mission in the coming years will be the unwavering commitment to strengthen 21st-century competencies among our students. Our aim is not just to impart knowledge but to empower our students with the skills, resilience, and adaptability necessary to thrive in an ever-evolving world. We believe in nurturing their intellectual curiosity, adaptive and inventive thinking, civic literacy, and communication competencies among others.

In the pursuit of nurturing 21st-century competencies among our students, we recognize the irreplaceable influence of parental involvement. Your insights, engagement, and constructive contributions not only enhance our educational programmes but also create a synergistic relationship between home and school—an alliance that empowers our students to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.

**_Joining Hands Together_**

Together, as a united community, we shall forge ahead, cherishing our past achievements while embracing the transformative journey that lies ahead. As the Chinese proverb goes &nbsp;“十年树木，百年树人(仁)” nurturing our young takes both time and effort from everyone.&nbsp; I invite each and every one of you—students, parents and staff—to join hands as we script this new chapter in the legacy of our beloved school, Angsana Primary School.

With gratitude for our past and enthusiasm for our future,
