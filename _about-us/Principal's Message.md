Welcome to the website of Angsana Primary School! The contents will give you a good understanding of our school and our mission in preparing our students for the future.




<b>A Little about me</b>

I embarked on my career in education as a Chemistry and Mathematics teacher. Due to unique circumstances in the first few years, I had opportunities to teach various subjects in the secondary school curriculum. This experience allowed me to understand the significance of interdisciplinary learning. Through this exposure, I gained a deep appreciation for the fusion of knowledge and perspectives from various disciplines and the range of pedagogy for teaching different subjects. I led two other primary schools after a meaningful stint as a Vice-Principal in a Catholic secondary school before coming to Angsana Primary School.

<b>A merger of two great schools</b>
         
Angsana Primary School today is the result of&nbsp;**the merging of two long-established primary schools**&nbsp;in the Tampines. These two institutions have nurtured young minds for an impressive 145 years, giving us a vibrant heritage.

<b>Where we are now</b>
        
Initially, Angsana Primary School started on the premises of the former Griffiths Primary School. The building, constructed in 1985, held a significant position along the Tampines Heartmap Trail in 2015, as it was recognised as part of the history and heritage of Tampines when the estate commemorated the nation's Golden Jubilee that year. However, we bade a nostalgic farewell to the campus in the middle of 2022, as we relocated to our present campus in the north of Tampines estate. Today, our students are fortunate to benefit from new&nbsp;**facilities at our new school campus**, enriching their educational journey and enhancing their overall learning experiences.

The relocation to our new campus has opened up a world of possibilities and exciting learning opportunities for our dedicated staff and eager students. Embarking on this fresh new chapter, we have expanded our family to welcome MK@Angsana, which had a strong start on the new campus before the primary school moved in.
