Welcome to the website of Angsana Primary School! The contents will give you a good understanding of our school and our mission in preparing our students for the future.




<b>A Little about me</b>

I embarked on my career in education as a Chemistry and Mathematics teacher. Due to unique circumstances in the first few years, I had opportunities to teach various subjects in the secondary school curriculum. This experience allowed me to understand the significance of interdisciplinary learning. Through this exposure, I gained a deep appreciation for the fusion of knowledge and perspectives from various disciplines and the range of pedagogy for teaching different subjects. I led two other primary schools after a meaningful stint as a Vice-Principal in a Catholic secondary school before coming to Angsana Primary School.

<b>A merger of two great schools</b>
         
Angsana Primary School today is the result of <b><u>the merging of two long-established primary schools</u></b> in the Tampines. These two institutions have nurtured young minds for an impressive 145 years, giving us a vibrant heritage.

<b>Where we are now</b>
        
Initially, Angsana Primary School started on the premises of the former Griffiths Primary School. The building, constructed in 1985, held a significant position along the Tampines Heartmap Trail in 2015, as it was recognised as part of the history and heritage of Tampines when the estate commemorated the nation's Golden Jubilee that year. However, we bade a nostalgic farewell to the campus in the middle of 2022, as we relocated to our present campus in the north of Tampines estate. Today, our students are fortunate to benefit from new <b><u>facilities at our new school campus</u></b>, enriching their educational journey and enhancing their overall learning experiences.

The relocation to our new campus has opened up a world of possibilities and exciting learning opportunities for our dedicated staff and eager students. Embarking on this fresh new chapter, we have expanded our family to welcome MK@Angsana, which had a strong start on the new campus before the primary school moved in.

<b>Our school values</b>
        

Our school derives its name from the majestic&nbsp;<b><u>Angsana tree</u></b>, a common roadside tree in Singapore known for its exceptional shade-giving qualities. The name of our school in Chinese,&nbsp;**树仁**&nbsp;(shu rƏn), translated as Tree of Benevolence, holds deep symbolism, representing our school's fundamental purpose and commitment. We intentionally nurture and guide our students to embody benevolence and a genuine concern for others, fostering a culture of learning, service, and care. In addition, we support the Singapore Kindness Movement and work with partners to teach values in action.

The acronym R3n represents our&nbsp;<b><u>school values</u></b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;**R**espect,&nbsp;**R**esilience,&nbsp;**R**esponsibility, and I**n**tegrity. Our teachers are responsible for instilling these values within our students, creating an environment that fosters mutual care and support. Our ultimate objective is to cultivate confident leaders and caring citizens. Through our&nbsp;<b><u>Learn for Life Programme (LLP)</u></b>,&nbsp;we provide our students with the necessary tools to develop their leadership skills, starting as early as Primary 1. We guide them through the transformative journey of learning the 7 Habits of Happy Kids and embracing the Leadership Challenge Model. Our pupils are also equipped with Peer Support Skills to enable them to look out for and help each other.

<b>Preparing our students to be ready for the future</b>
         
At our school, our primary goal is to actively engage and empower every student to become prepared for the future. Problem-solving and 21st-century competencies are vital to being future-ready. Since 2017, we have witnessed successive cohorts of students cultivating essential learning, computational thinking, and coding skills through our&nbsp;<b><u>Applied Learning Programme (ALP),</u></b> which aims to foster their creative problem-solving abilities. Additionally, we host regular Tinker Tuesday events designed to stimulate children's thinking while they engage in hands-on experimentation and exploration.

Today we provide a good spread of Co-curricular Activities (CCAs) across four distinct categories: Sports and Games, Uniformed Groups, Clubs, and Performing Arts. These engaging activities are open to students from Primary 3 to Primary 6, fostering their holistic development and igniting their passions. As our enrolment continues to grow in the coming years, we can anticipate a corresponding expansion in the range of CCAs offered, ensuring an even more comprehensive array of enriching opportunities for our students.

<b>A heart of gratitude</b>
         
I sincerely thank our School Advisory Committee members, Parent Support Group members, and dedicated alumni for their unwavering support during last year's relocation. Your invaluable assistance and commitment were instrumental in ensuring a smooth transition for our school. In addition, I am deeply grateful for your ongoing involvement and encouragement as we forge ahead, embracing new learning opportunities for our students. Your steadfast support is very much appreciated.

Our staff has displayed remarkable resilience and adaptability in navigating the many changes over the past two years. Our dedicated teaching and support staff have demonstrated unwavering commitment, investing tireless effort to cultivate a nurturing and enjoyable environment where every child is known, safe, inspired, challenged, and empowered. My deep gratitude goes to all of you for embodying the true essence of our school motto and consistently going above and beyond to fulfil our shared vision.
