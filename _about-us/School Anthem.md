### Upwards Angsana!
----------------

Angsana is where our hopes and dreams begin, 

With courage we do what is right. 

Together we serve because we care, 

In our passion for learning we unite. 

	

Above and beyond, our flag flies high! 

Above and beyond, our best forever more! 

Upwards Angsana, Upwards Angsana 

Our School, our Joy, our Pride! 
  
	

We will lead with confidence and care, 

Our hearts ever grateful and true. 

Together we march to make our mark, 

With joy and smiles we journey through 
  


Above and beyond, we will succeed! 

Above and beyond, our best forever more! 

Upwards Angsana, Upwards Angsana 

Our School, our Joy, our Pride!
  
	

Upwards Angsana, Upwards Angsana 

Our School, our Joy, our Pride!
