Parent Support Group
====================

### The Angsana Primary School Parents Support Group

The ASPS Parent Support Group (PSG) is a voluntary group of parents and an integral part of the school community. The PSG works with the school to provide opportunities for parents to take part in the intellectual, social and emotional development of the children. Support is provided through a range of activities and services for our pupils, teachers and parents. We would like to encourage you to be involved and contribute to foster a vibrant and nurturing community. It is a wonderful opportunity to meet other parents and get involved in the life of the school. We welcome your participation and assure you that it is a worthwhile endeavour that you will find personally rewarding and fun!
