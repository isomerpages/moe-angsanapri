Science

### Learning Outcomes

We aim to do the following through the Science curriculum at Angsana Primary School:

*   Provide pupils with experiences that will nurture their interest and arouse their curiosity about the environment
*   Provide pupils with the opportunity to develop the necessary skills, attitudes and processes essential for scientific inquiry
*   Impart pupils with the necessary skills that will allow them to explore and pursue their interests
*   Allow pupils to understand how Science influences people and the environment

### Pedagogical Approaches

Our Science curriculum is designed around the 5E inquiry approach (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) in which learners actively construct meaning from their experiences in connection with their prior understanding. Opportunities are provided in and out of the classroom to pique pupilsâ€™ curiosity and allow them to explore the world, both in the classroom as well as beyond.

  

Hands-on activities engage pupils as well as develop in them an understanding of scientific investigations and concepts. Carefully selected enrichment programmes, e.g. learning journey to Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum and workshops conducted by the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Innovations in Science, are organised to augment learning amongst our pupils.
