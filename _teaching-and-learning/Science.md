Science
=======

### Learning Outcomes

We aim to do the following through the Science curriculum at Angsana Primary School:

*   Provide pupils with experiences that will nurture their interest and arouse their curiosity about the environment
*   Provide pupils with the opportunity to develop the necessary skills, attitudes and processes essential for scientific inquiry
*   Impart pupils with the necessary skills that will allow them to explore and pursue their interests
*   Allow pupils to understand how Science influences people and the environment

### Pedagogical Approaches

Our Science curriculum is designed around the 5E inquiry approach (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) in which learners actively construct meaning from their experiences in connection with their prior understanding. Opportunities are provided in and out of the classroom to pique pupils’ curiosity and allow them to explore the world, both in the classroom as well as beyond.

  

Hands-on activities engage pupils as well as develop in them an understanding of scientific investigations and concepts. Carefully selected enrichment programmes, e.g. learning journey to Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum and workshops conducted by the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Innovations in Science, are organised to augment learning amongst our pupils.


### Key Programmes

<b> Engaging Students to Take Climate Action for a Sustainable Future </b>

Singapore has designated 2019 as the Year Towards Zero Waste. This involves getting Singaporeans to reduce, reuse, recycle more, and recycle right, to adopt lifestyle habits that minimise waste generation.

  

In an effort to encourage the school community to reduce our carbon footprint, assembly programmes and classroom activities are organised to raise our pupils’ awareness of on how everyone can play a part in reducing waste and moving towards a sustainable future.

  

Notwithstanding, our Environment Champions learn to manage food waste in a holistic manner by focussing on minimisation and recycling. They use food digesters to turn food waste into compost for plants in the school. Through their heightened awareness and active participation, pupils are exposed to reduce and recycle food waste and contribute towards Singapore becoming a Zero Waste Nation.

<b> Science Talent Programme </b>

This programme focuses on developing, building on the existing or prior knowledge of the pupils. Pupils are require to make use of their inquiry and critical thinking skills to understand the concept behind each topic covered. The lessons are based on the broad science themes in the primary science curriculum and are focused on introducing the various domains of Science to the pupils and also to enhance their general knowledge. Pupils with suitable aptitude and skills will be selected to participate in the Singapore Primary Science Olympiads organised by Raffles Institution and NUS High School.

  

Singapore Primary Science Olympiads organised by Raffles Institution and NUS High School are postponed to 2021.
