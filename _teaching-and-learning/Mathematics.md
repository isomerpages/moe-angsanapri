Mathematics
===========

### Learning Outcomes

At Angsana Primary School, the Mathematics department is committed to providing students with varied opportunities to learn concepts, skills and attitudes to become competent problem solvers. Not only do we strive to make learning fun for our students, we also promote the development of 21st century competencies which will serve them well in the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) future.

  
### Our Guiding Principles

<b> Mathematics teachers in Angsana Primary School are guided by the following principles: </b>

1.<b> Differentiating Teaching and Learning is our Philosophy </b> 

Each child is unique and learns differently. We vary our instruction and included hands-on activities and technology in our lessons to allow our students to explore, reflect and evaluate their own understanding and develop problem-solving skills.

2.<b> Reasoning, Communication and Connections is our Cornerstone </b> 

As we strive to nurture our students to be critical thinkers and effective problem solvers, opportunities are provided for our students to express Mathematical ideas and arguments precisely, concisely and logically.
