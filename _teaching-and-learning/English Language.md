English Language
================

### Learning Outcomes

The English Language programme at Angsana Primary School aims to:

*   develop the love for the English Language in students;
*   develop our students to be effective and confident communicators of the English Language; and
*   engage our students in rich learning experiences to develop the language skills of reading, listening, speaking and writing.



### Pedagogical Approaches


The school adopts the STELLAR (**St**rategies for **E**nglish **L**anguage **L**earning **A**nd **R**eading) programme in the teaching and learning of English Language. Learning tasks and activities are designed for students to learn language skills in authentic and meaningful contexts. The skills will be taught, revised and revisited at increasing levels of difficulty and complexity as the child progresses from the foundational level to higher levels of language use.
  

### Key Programmes

<b> Englishtopia </b>

Englishtopia is a week-long celebration of the English Language in Angsana Primary School. It provides opportunities for students to explore the beauty of the English Language through various activities ranging from classroom quizzes and competitions to school-wide performances and talks by students and professionals.
