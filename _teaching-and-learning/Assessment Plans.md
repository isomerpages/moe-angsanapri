Assessment is an integral part of the learning process, and must be closely aligned with curricular objectives, content and pedagogy. Both school-based assessment and national examinations play important and different roles in our education system. A balanced assessment should have both Assessment of Learning as well as Assessment for Learning. Whether implemented as national exams or in the classroom, assessment should lead to meaningful learning.
