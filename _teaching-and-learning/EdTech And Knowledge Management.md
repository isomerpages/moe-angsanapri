<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>

<p><strong>Digital Communication and Expression</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

and communicate with teachers and classmates. They will develop skills
to express their thoughts clearly in the digital space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Digital Learning</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Become respectful digital citizens who can work well with others online.
They will learn to share ideas constructively, give helpful feedback, and
work together on digital platforms to showcase their understanding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Independent Digital Learning</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop self-directed learning skills using technology. Through platforms
like the Student Learning Space (SLS), they will learn to identify areas

</ul>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>In line with MOE’s EdTech Masterplan 2030, Angsana Primary School aims
to enable students to harness technology to enhance their learning and
develop their 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies (21CC). This is achieved
through meaningful integration of technology into students’ learning experiences
and equipping them with digital literacy and technology skills. At Angsana
Primay School, teachers are guided by the EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold to
design our lessons.</p>

<h3>Digital Literacy Programme</h3>
<p>Apart from experiencing how technology is used to complement the learning
in different subjects, school-wide routines and expectations for the use
of technology is also put in place to equip our students with the necessary
skills required to learn with technology. More details can be found in
pages 45 to 55 of the Pupil’s Companion.</p>

<p>To equip our students with life-long social-emotional competencies and
sound values to be safe, respectful and responsible users of technology,
cyber wellness values are taught through a variety of learning activities
using a thematic approach (see table below).</p>
