<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>In line with MOE’s EdTech Masterplan 2030, Angsana Primary School aims
to enable students to harness technology to enhance their learning and
develop their 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies (21CC). This is achieved
through meaningful integration of technology into students’ learning experiences
and equipping them with digital literacy and technology skills. At Angsana
Primay School, teachers are guided by the EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold to
design our lessons.</p>
