### Applied Learning Programme
We guide our students in the development of Computational Thinking (CT) concepts and CT attitudes such as imagination, thinking out of the box, making productive mistakes, collaboration and persevering to find solutions.&nbsp; The children learn to be curious, and create and learn to be eco-stewards and eco-advocates in promoting sustainable and smart living.
We are aware that we can no longer anticipate all the problems and challenges that our students will face in the future. With such ambiguities and complexities, the skills of being able to recognise patterns, break down problems and come out with relevant solutions are critical ones required of our students to thrive in the workforce in future. Thus, as a school, it is a priority to lead students to think critically, be savvy at problem-solving and develop an ‘I Can’ attitude when faced with challenges.
