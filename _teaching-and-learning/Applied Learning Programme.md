### Nurturing Problem Solvers using Computational Thinking
------------------------------------------------------

In our school, we lead our students to experience the joy of learning and be intrinsically motivated to embrace lifelong learning. &nbsp;&nbsp;In alignment with our mission to engage and empower our students to be future-ready, we recognise the importance of intentionally teaching 21st century skills thus we provide opportunities for our students to develop aptitudes and attitudes such as critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities.  

  

We are aware that we can no longer anticipate all the problems and challenges that our students will face in the future. With such ambiguities and complexities, the skills of being able to recognise patterns, break down problems and come out with relevant solutions are critical ones required of our students to thrive in the workforce in future. Thus, as a school, it is a priority to lead students to think critically, be savvy at problem-solving and develop an ‘I Can’ attitude when faced with challenges.&nbsp;  

**Key Focus Areas**  

Through our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), students develop Computational Thinking (CT) concepts such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithm design. They also develop CT attitudes such as imagination, thinking out of the box, making productive mistakes, collaboration and persevering to find solutions.

By equipping our students with these key attitudes and skills early at the primary school level, we lay the foundation for our students to remain steadfast, competitive and be well adapted in the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world.Through our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), students develop Computational Thinking (CT) concepts such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithm design. They also develop CT attitudes such as imagination, thinking out of the box, making productive mistakes, collaboration and persevering to find solutions.  

**Positive outcomes of ALP for students**  

Students develop critical thinking skills that enhance their abilities to solve problems in real life proactively and effectively. They work well in teams and collaborate with their peers to achieve a common goal. Through it all, students cultivate a lively curiosity about their environment and want to do something to make it better.&nbsp;

**Integration into the Curriculum**  

The programme takes off by introducing the lower primary students to the five Computational Thinking (CT) concepts; pattern recognition, decomposition, algorithmic design and, generalisation and abstraction through enrichment lessons. &nbsp;Thereafter, the teaching of problem solving skills through Computational Thinking are infused in our Mathematics curriculum in a spiral approach.

**Customised Coding Lessons**

Learning experiences to develop CT attitudes such as imagination, thinking out of the box, making productive mistakes, collaboration and persevering to find solutions through various modes are created for students at different levels.
