Applied Learning Programme
==========================

### Nurturing Problem Solvers using Computational Thinking
------------------------------------------------------

In our school, we lead our students to experience the joy of learning and be intrinsically motivated to embrace lifelong learning. In alignment with our mission to engage and empower our students to be future-ready, we recognise the importance of intentionally teaching 21st century skills thus we provide opportunities for our students to develop aptitudes and attitudes such as critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities.

  

We are aware that we can no longer anticipate all the problems and challenges that our students will face in the future. With such ambiguities and complexities, the skills of being able to recognise patterns, break down problems and come out with relevant solutions are critical ones required of our students to thrive in the workforce in future. Thus, as a school, it is a priority to lead students to think critically, be savvy at problem-solving and develop an ‘I Can’ attitude when faced with challenges.

<b> Key Focus Areas </b>

Through our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), students develop Computational Thinking (CT) concepts such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithm design. They also develop CT attitudes such as imagination, thinking out of the box, making productive mistakes, collaboration and persevering to find solutions.

  

By equipping our students with these key attitudes and skills early at the primary school level, we lay the foundation for our students to remain steadfast, competitive and be well adapted in the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world.
