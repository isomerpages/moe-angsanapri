### Approach

Students are given opportunities to use technology to build 21st century competencies essential for them to meet the demands of the future world. The use of technology is meaningfully integrated into our core curriculum for our students to (a) experience and demonstrate learning beyond the traditional pen and paper mode of assessment, (b) be engaged in self-directed learning (SDL) and collaborative learning (CoL) within and beyond the classrooms (c) learn how to be safe digital learners and show responsible behaviours online. To complement and enrich our students’ learning, baseline lessons are also designed and assigned to our students via the Singapore Student Learning Space.

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of 6 years in Angsana Primary School, we want our students to be able to

*   Use technology to interact with content and others and express their ideas confidently (student-content interaction, student-teacher interaction, student-student interaction)
*   Use technology to interact with others respectfully to share ideas, provide feedback and co-create digital learning artefacts to demonstrate understanding (NML/CW/Baseline ICT Standards)
*   Take ownership of one’s learning and uses ICT, including SLS, to assess and close one’s own learning gaps and further one’s learning

### Digital Literacy Programme

Apart from experiencing how technology is used to complement the learning in different subjects, school-wide routines and expectations for the use of technology is also put in place to equip our students with the necessary skills during e-learning. More details can be found in pages 44 to 45 of the Pupil’s Companion.

### Cyber Wellness Programme  

To equip our students with life-long social-emotional competencies and sound values to be safe, respectful and responsible users of technology, cyber wellness values are taught through a variety of learning activities using a thematic approach (see table below).

The availability of computing devices and internet access at home will enable our students to enjoy learning anytime, anywhere and even provide opportunities for meaningful online collaboration to consolidate and share what they have learnt with their peers. The NEU PC Plus Programme by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) offers students from low income households the opportunity to own a computer at affordable price.
