InfoComm Technology
===================

### Approach

Students are given opportunities to use technology to build 21st century competencies essential for them to meet the demands of the future world. The use of technology is meaningfully integrated into our core curriculum for our students to (a) experience and demonstrate learning beyond the traditional pen and paper mode of assessment, (b) be engaged in self-directed learning (SDL) and collaborative learning (CoL) within and beyond the classrooms (c) learn how to be safe digital learners and show responsible behaviours online. To complement and enrich our students’ learning, baseline lessons are also designed and assigned to our students via the Singapore Student Learning Space.

### Learning Outcomes


At the end of 6 years in Angsana Primary School, we want our students to be able to

*   Use technology to interact with content and others and express their ideas confidently (student-content interaction, student-teacher interaction, student-student interaction)
*   Use technology to interact with others respectfully to share ideas, provide feedback and co-create digital learning artefacts to demonstrate understanding (NML/CW/Baseline ICT Standards)
*   Take ownership of one’s learning and uses ICT, including SLS, to assess and close one’s own learning gaps and further one’s learning

### Digital Literacy Programme


Apart from experiencing how technology is used to complement the learning in different subjects, school-wide routines and expectations for the use of technology is also put in place to equip our students with the necessary skills during e-learning. More details can be found in pages 44 to 45 of the Pupil’s Companion.
