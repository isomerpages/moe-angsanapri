### Learning Outcomes

  
We aim to do the following through the Physical Education Curriculum at Angsana Primary School:  

*   Develop our pupils to be physically educated, equipping them to be competent in fundamental movements
*   Provide opportunities for our pupils to participate in a variety of sports and games
*   Inculcate in our pupils with good physical education knowledge, attitudes and values, so they can go on to lead active and healthy lifestyles throughout their lives

### Pedagogical Approaches  

Our PE teachers are all qualified PE teachers and they employ a wide spectrum of approaches in the teaching of Physical Education. These include the Movement Education Model, Games Concept Approach (GCA) and Sports Education Model.
