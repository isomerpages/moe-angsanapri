Our library is a place where our students are engaged in various reading and learning activities. Computing devices such as laptops and iPads are made available to students for them to use during recess time and after school to do research and access learning portals for self-directed learning.

To promote the love for reading in our school, our students are invited to participate in the following programmes:

**Thematic Displays &amp; Activities**

To encourage reading in the school, our library features monthly book collections according to themes. Themes and book collections are highlighted during morning assemblies. Some of the themes featured are ‘The Secret World of Spies’, ‘The World of Folklore’ and ‘From Books to Movies’. Our library also promotes books written by authors such as Roald Dahl, Hans Christian Andersen and Louis Sachar. Students can also participate in the various activities (quizzes, games etc) that are tied to the thematic book collections.

**Storytelling Sessions**

During recess on some days, students get to enjoy storytelling sessions conducted by the staff in school. The aim of the session is to promote joy of reading and to encourage students to explore books of different genres.
