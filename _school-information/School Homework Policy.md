School Homework Policy
======================

### Rationale


Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required by the school to complete outside of curriculum time. This includes assignments and projects but not revision of school work or studying for tests and examinations.

  

Homework, when used appropriately, can reinforce students’ learning, provide feedback on their progress and cultivate a healthy disposition towards continual learning.

  

*   Effective use of homework can:

1.  reinforce learning and deepen understanding of lessons taught;
2.  allow students to regularly practise, and apply skills and concepts taught;
3.  develop good study skills and habits; and
4.  encourage greater ownership and responsibility for independent learning.

*   Homework also provides parents/guardians with:

1.  timely information on the learning progress of their child; and
2.  opportunity to be involved in the child’s learning.
