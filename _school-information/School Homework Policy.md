School Homework Policy
======================

### Rationale


Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required by the school to complete outside of curriculum time. This includes assignments and projects but not revision of school work or studying for tests and examinations.

  

Homework, when used appropriately, can reinforce students’ learning, provide feedback on their progress and cultivate a healthy disposition towards continual learning.

  

*   Effective use of homework can:

a.  reinforce learning and deepen understanding of lessons taught;

b.  allow students to regularly practise, and apply skills and concepts taught;

c.  develop good study skills and habits; and

d.  encourage greater ownership and responsibility for independent learning.

*   Homework also provides parents/guardians with:

a.  timely information on the learning progress of their child; and

b.  opportunity to be involved in the child’s learning.


### Key Considerations and Guiding Principles

### Amount of Homework


It is important to keep in mind that is the quality of learning and not the amount of homework that matters. The amount of homework\* assigned will be calibrated accordingly by our teachers, taking into consideration the following:

a.  For holistic development, students need a balanced life with adequate time for family bonding, social activities, personal interests and rest;

b.  The amount of homework given to be age-appropriate and take into account the competing demands on students’ time (e.g. CCA, competitions, enrichment classes, tests, examinations);

c.  Amount of homework assigned to students to be differentiated according to levels that the students are in; and

d.  Homework will be relatively less for long school days when students have extra lessons or activities.

  

*   Our Subject teachers will coordinate among themselves to ensure students are not overloaded. Form Teacher of each class will oversee to ensure assessments like tests or spelling will not be on the same day.

*   Reading is an essential learning activity and it is expected that all students read daily. As such, reading assignments may also be included in the suggested time allowance for homework.

*   The homework assigned will be designed such that students should be spending about 1-2 hours per day to complete them. Do note there will be home-work free days too. Students are advised to use these times wisely, e.g. to revise school work, or to prepare for tests and examinations

  

<b>Types and Purposes of Homework \[1\]</b>

In general, there are four types of homework that will be assigned by our teachers. The purposes of these types of homework are:
