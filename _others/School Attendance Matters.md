School Attendance Matters
=========================

School attendance is an integral part of a child’s schooling journey and crucial to their success in school. We constantly emphasise to students the value of resilience and encourage them to attend school regularly. This will also ensure their learning and progress is not unduly affected.

  

The school accepts medical certificates and parent letters to account for a student’s absence from school. A <u><b>maximum of 5 letters per semester</b></u> from parents/guardians to explain a child’s absence from school will be permitted. Parents are strongly advised to contact their child’s Form Teacher for any concerns or clarifications.
