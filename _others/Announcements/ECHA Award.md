<h3>2024 MOE Edusave Character Award</h3>
<p>In 2012, MOE introduced the Edusave Character Award (ECHA) to enable schools
to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding
personal qualities through their behaviour and actions. This is part of
the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore as schools
broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded.</p>
<p>At Angsana Primary School, we wish to recognise students who consistently
live up to the school values and are good role models to others around
them.</p>
<p>To be eligible for the award, the student must be a <strong><u>Singapore Citizen</u></strong>.
He/She should attain a conduct grade of either “Very Good” or ‘Excellent’
for the current year. For a more holistic representation of the awardees,
the school will be gathering input from teachers, parents, students and
other stakeholders, which include CCA coaches and school vendors. We would
like to invite parents and other stakeholders to nominate students who
are deserving of the award. You may <a href="/files/2023%20echa%20nomination%20form.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download</a> the form
from the school website and submit it after completion to the school office
by <strong>Friday, 2 August 2024</strong>.</p>
