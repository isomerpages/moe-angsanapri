<u><b>Tips #3:</b></u>&nbsp;Appropriate online expression refers to online communication which is socially appropriate and does not bring about conflicting opinions and stereotypes. Inappropriate online expression may affect a child’s social, emotional and mental well-being. Click [here](/files/appropriate%20online%20expression.pdf) to read up on how parents can help.

  

<u><b>Tips #4:</b></u>&nbsp;How do you help your child with appropriate online expression? With appropriate online expression, one can create a meaningful and positive presence in the cyber community. We must guide our young people from engaging in inappropriate postings, either intentionally or unintentionally.

  

Examples of inappropriate online expressions include using vulgarities, pretending to be someone else, posting insensitive content and going too far in attracting “likes” online. These are serious concerns because

  

*   Everything online is searchable, replicable and contributes to a permanent digital reputation
*   Inappropriate online expression may affect a child’s social, emotional and mental well-being

  

How can parents help? You can do so by:

  

*   Modelling respectful forms of online expressions
*   Sharing examples of positive online expressions
*   Encouraging the use of the T.H.I.N.K. framework before posting anything online (True.Helpful.Inspiring.Necessary.Kind)
*   Discussing with your child on the need to respect differences in views, opinions and beliefs
*   Monitoring the interactions of your child with others on social media and online games

  

<u><b>Tips #5:</b></u>&nbsp;With the abundance of information that is readily available online, it is important for us to have the ability to tell online falsehoods apart from information that is true and reliable. Online falsehoods can spread quickly through people who intentionally create or spread false information. Read up on how parents can help here.
